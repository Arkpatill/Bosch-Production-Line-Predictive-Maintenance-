Predictive Maintenance for Bosch Production Line using Modern Technologies
Introduction
This project leverages machine learning, deep learning, and interactive data visualization to predict failures in Bosch production line machinery before they occur. By analyzing telemetry, maintenance, error, and failure data, the system proactively identifies potential breakdowns, reduces unplanned downtime, and optimizes maintenance schedules.

Problem Statement
In today’s business world, downtimes and errors can have a huge impact—causing financial losses, damaging reputation, and disrupting market flow. This project aims to address these challenges by implementing predictive maintenance powered by advanced analytics and visualization.

Dataset
Source: Public Bosch Production Line dataset

Features:

Telemetry data: pressure, rotation, vibration, voltage
